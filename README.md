- 👋 Hi, I’m Andres Buitrago
- 👀 I’m love of almost any kind of technology, I guess that's the reason why I'm a Fan of Iron Man. Also, it video games, not a pro but I have my good games when playing online
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS and React as I'm looking to start as a Front End Developer while I expand my knowledge and learn a few more languages and technologies
- 💞️ I’m looking to move away from the operation management role I'm now and become a software developer and engineer. I have my bachelor degree in Computer Science / System Engineer but never followed that path, until now!. So I'm looking to collaborate with any project where I can learn and grow as a successful developer
- 📫 You can reach out to me though email - buitrago001@gmail.com or WhatsApp - +573102199997
