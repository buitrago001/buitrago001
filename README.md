- 👋 Hi, I’m Andres Buitrago
- 🌱 I got my bachelor’s degree in computer science as a System Engineer, where I learned about different programming languages, mainly JAVA, however after work for many years in corporate, I starting to build a new profile as I´m looking forward changing my career and become a Software developer. 
I learned HTML, CSS and JS and learning about React I'm looking to start as a Front-End Developer while I continue to learn and expand my knowledge on the language I already learn and learning new languages and technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to move away from the operation management role and become a software developer. I have my bachelor degree in Computer Science / System Engineer but never followed that path, until now! 
- So I'm looking to collaborate with any project where I can learn and grow as a successful developer
