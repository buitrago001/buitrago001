- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew

I am a results-driven System Engineer, currently in my final semester, with a strong passion for data analysis and a track record of leveraging technical expertise to extract actionable insights. My diverse skill set includes proficiency in SQL for relational databases, Excel, and the creation of data-driven dashboards. I am also well-versed in programming languages, particularly Python, and possess exceptional presentation and data storytelling skills.

My career journey has equipped me with a robust foundation in analytical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving. With a decade of experience serving clients in the United States across a range of industries, including retail, software, electronics, banking, fintech, delivery, logistics, and e-commerce, I have honed my ability to dissect complex datasets and uncover valuable patterns.

My previous roles have involved working extensively with data related to customer experiences, tech support processes, and sales, allowing me to develop a keen understanding of business operations and customer behavior. This experience has fueled my desire to transition into a dedicated Data Analyst role, where I can leverage my technical expertise and analytical mindset to drive data-informed decision-making.

I bring a unique blend of technical prowess and a customer-centric perspective, making me well-equipped to contribute to data-driven initiatives and deliver impactful insights that drive business growth. My passion for data, coupled with my ability to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, positions me as a valuable asset in the field of data analysis.

As I embark on this exciting career transition, I am eager to bring my skills and experiences to a dynamic team where I can continue to develop my data analysis expertise and make a meaningful impact.
