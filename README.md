- 👋 Hi, I’m Andres Buitrago
- 🌱 Through collage I learn programming mainly using JAVA, however after work for many years in corporate, I starting to build a new profile and be able to change my carrer and become a developer and a software engineer. I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS and React as I'm looking to start as a Front End Developer while I continue to learn and expand my knowledge with other programming languages and technologies
- 💞️ I’m looking to move away from the operation management role I am now and become a software developer. I have my bachelor degree in Computer Science / System Engineer but never followed that path, until now!. 
- So I'm looking to collaborate with any project where I can learn and grow as a successful developer
