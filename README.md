- 👋 Hi, I’m Andres Buitrago
- 🌱 I got my bachelor’s degree in computer science as a System Engineer, where I learned about different programming languages, mainly JAVA, however after work a few years as Tech Lead in corporate, I starting to re-build a my profile as I´m looking forward become a Software developer (fullstack). 
💞️ I learned multiple Front-End technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, React.JS) I also have work in some small projects using JAVA and Python.  
I continue studing to expand my knowledge on the language I already learned and learning new languages and technologies.
Rightnow I am learning Backend basics
- So I'm looking to collaborate with any project where I can learn and grow as a successful developer
